Cloud9 Review - Browser Based IDE

I have personally developed Enterprise web applications, via a web browser, for the past 8 years, and “yes,” you can develop highly complex, and scalable applications from a browser based IDE. Now, the tool that I have used has a huge barrier to entry of cost, complexity, and is a proprietary solution (locked in to a single vendor). Regardless, my browser based experience has been favorable, and I am totally sold on this concept.

In 2012, I was so excited to stumble onto Cloud9’s IDE service in the cloud. But, my experience was not exactly what I expected (or maybe should have expected). In a nutshell super buggy! But, their concept was superior to all others in the same market space.

It is 2014, and I am back on Cloud9 and at first blush - NICE!

The following is from a previous Blog entry. Below is an example of the Classical development stack that is so pervasive in IT land.
<p style="text-align: center;">“Doing  enterprise level Java development is like driving a Mac Truck over a tight skinny wood bridge-doable but not pretty. Think of the Web stack: Web Server, Application server, Database,  Java framework (shit this can go 10 levels deep), JDA, JDO, EJB, JMS, XML, XLST, Spring, ANT, JMS, MVC, JSF,  not to mention security, authentication, authorization, and don’t forget Performance. Now, you need DBA, WAS administrator, Linux Admins, Security experts, Java Developers, Java Architects, Project Managers and God forbid a Project Manager. The present has become BIG, BAD, and UGLY. You could say it has become a bit loony.”</p>
As mentioned above, Does Cloud9’s IDE elevate the monster development stack? No. But, with the combination of new technologies, such as Node, and No-SQL database, Yes, Cloud9 does the job.

I believe that IT is getting their brains back, and will naturally swing back to a simpler pragmatic model. And, I believe Cloud9 will play a critical role in this changing landscape. With full stack web development using Javascript, and NO-SQL databases, Cloud9 has positioned themselves as a strong player in this market space.
<p style="text-align: center;">“What the Crud? Simple – Create, Read, Update and Delete. CRUD is not rocket science. What the UI? Javascript, yes JQUERY on a rope. My goodness, the separation of data and UI is real and again simple (another post). What the DB? High priest of Database design – aka. Obfuscation. Get rid of the priest. What the Heck – HTML5, JavaScript and No SQL database, is the past coming back to our future. No kidding, its like the mainframe days only now the mainframe is the whole darn INTERNET! And Heck – the nucking mainframe was easy!”</p>
The real magic is that I can power up just about any computer that has a modern browser and do what I like doing most “Writing beautiful Code.”

Cloud9 has my 5-star rating.
